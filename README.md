# DAT076-Web-Applications
Web applications course on Chalmers university of technology.

### Aim with the course

The aim of the course is to give students a broad introduction to web-based applications like e-commerce sites.

### Content

The course introduces a number of technologies used for developing web applications. The role of each technology and how the they fit together is examined. The course gives a good understanding of how modern web applications are built. Design problems associated with web applications, session handling, navigation, persistence and more are discussed. Information retrieval is an important aspect of the course. The course emphasize hands-on work using modern advanced development environments and server environments. Configuration and deployment of web applications plays a vital role.

Some of the content from the course:

- XML technologies (XML, XMLSchema, m.m.).
- Rich Internet Applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, m.m.)

- Java Enterprise Edition (Servlet API, Java Persistence API, Java Server Faces, Enterprise Java Beans, m.m.)

- Webservices (SOAP, REST, m.m.)


### Objectives on the workshops

**Workshop 1**

Get some background: HTTP, a web server, some tools and the basic client techniques HTML, CSS and ECMAScript (JavaScript)


**Workshop 2**

Exploring server side MVC using a heavy (but rock solid) backend (.NET/JEE style, illustrated here using Java EE).
Basic concepts: request, response, sessions, redirect, forward, server side components, etc


**Workshop 3**

Object relational mapping, ORM, and handling of the web application persistence layer (using .NET/JEE style).


**Workshop 4**

Introduction to the REST-ful architecture (again using JEE as backend)


**Workshop 5**

Task is to implement a client side (close to) single page MVC-applications (SPAs) using ES6 and an in-house MVC-design. The client will communicate with a REST backend using AJAX (backend from previous workshop).


**Workshop 6**

Server side JavaScript running on NodeJS, introducing the Express framework (MVC), TypeORM (ORM) and Mustache HTML-templates (for dynamic data in pages).


**Project**

There were also a project in the couse which you can see here: https://github.com/Tithera/DAT076-Web-Applications-Project
